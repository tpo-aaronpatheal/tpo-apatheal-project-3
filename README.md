# Project 3- Interactive Form Validation

This project contains form validators which checks the users input in required fields. This form includes 
a keyup event which provides real time error messaging under the Name, email, credit card, zip code, and cvv 
input fields. The error message will display as the user is entering information and will display until the user has met 
the validator requirements. There are two conditional error messages that display for the name and email field depending on the user input. Both fields have a 'Field cannot be blank' error message. The name field also has a 'Field cannot contain any numerical or special characters' error message. The email field has a 'Email address must be correctly formatted' error message as well. I would like to note that for extra practice, I utilized javascript to alter the error message  that displays for the credit card field musing the .textContent method. Lastly, I used the regex replace() method to format the users credit card input to include dashes("-"). I did this as a way to get extra practice using the regex concepts that were discussed in Unit 3.
